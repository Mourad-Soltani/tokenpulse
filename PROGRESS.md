# Tokenpulse – Progress & Handoff Log

## Project Goal

Private AI FinOps + shadow-AI control plane. Meter tokens, attribute spend, enforce budget/data policy at a self-hosted gateway, export audit packs for CFO and CISO. Target: strong product + early traction → $1B+ exit path within ~12 months (AI FinOps / TRiSM adjacency).

## Current Status (Session 2 — 2026-09-13)

- [x] Repository created (`Mourad-Soltani/tokenpulse`)
- [x] Bootstrap: README, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP, PROGRESS, package.json, tsconfig, gitignore
- [x] Successor to closed Aether Forge daily-builder loop (client handover)
- [x] OpenAI-compatible gateway skeleton (`POST /v1/chat/completions`)
- [x] Mock upstream when `TOKENPULSE_MOCK_UPSTREAM=1`
- [x] Usage ledger JSONL (`data/ledger/<day>.jsonl`) + cost estimate table
- [x] Team/app attribution via `X-Tokenpulse-Team` / `X-Tokenpulse-App`
- [x] Secret-free `npm run demo`
- [x] Tests (`pricing`, `ledger`, `gateway`) + CLI `--summary` / `--export`
- [x] Daily budget check per team (`TOKENPULSE_BUDGETS_PATH` / `TOKENPULSE_DEFAULT_DAILY_USD`)
- [x] HTTP 429 `budget_exceeded` + ledger `decision: block`
- [ ] Live upstream forward
- [ ] Model allow/deny list
- [ ] Minimal dashboard

## Next Up (highest priority)

1. **Session 3:** Live upstream forward when mock is off (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` / `TOKENPULSE_UPSTREAM_*`). Keys env-only; never in chat. Keep mock as default demo path.
2. Model allow/deny list (after live forward or in parallel if small).
3. Dashboard only after meter + budget + one live-forward path exists (can stay mock-gated).

## Decisions So Far

- Stack: TypeScript (Node 20+), Zod, Node `http` for gateway.
- Self-host first; loopback default (`127.0.0.1:8788`).
- Raw prompts **not** stored by default. Ledger stores `requestHash` only.
- Distinct from Aether Forge: no workflow orchestrator; focus is gateway + ledger + policy.
- Pricing table is approximate (static map for common models); operators can override via config later.
- No secrets in git. Upstream keys env-only.
- Session 1: live upstream returns 501 until Session 3. Demo and tests use mock only.
- Gateway token optional; if `TOKENPULSE_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set, require `Authorization: Bearer` or `X-Tokenpulse-Token`. `/health` stays open.
- Streaming rejected in v0.1.
- Session 2: daily USD cap is per team, counted from **allowed** events for UTC day in the ledger. Missing config = unlimited. Team `dailyUsd: 0` hard-blocks. Default file example: `budgets.example.json`. Blocked requests do not increment spend.

## Handoff for next session

Session 2 ships daily team budget enforcement. Next slice is live upstream forward behind env keys (never paste keys into chat).

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run demo
TOKENPULSE_MOCK_UPSTREAM=1 TOKENPULSE_GATEWAY_TOKEN=dev-local-token npm run start:gateway
```
